Siddhartha Gautama, most commonly referred to as the Buddha the awakened was a wandering ascetic and religious teacher who lived in South Asia during the 6th or 5th century
 and founded Buddhism. According to Buddhist legends, he was born in Lumbini, in what is now Nepal,[b] to royal parents of the Shakya clan, but renounced his home life to live as a wandering ascetic.
 After leading a life of mendicancy, asceticism, and meditation, he attained nirvana at Bodh Gaya in what is now India.
